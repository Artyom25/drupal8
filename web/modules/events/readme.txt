if I use drupal to make what I want I need approximetely next architecture
whole
    calendar, tasks, task, blog(diary)
calendar
    day, week, month, year, color days with events
tasks
    tasks list, future tasks, single task, tasks tags
blog(diary)
    simple ct with textarea, title


actually I need events and tasks. events will be on calendar marked by one color(it will be changable), and tasks will be marked by another way.
